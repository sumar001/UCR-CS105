Contestants present their idea for a company to a panel of investors (a.k.a. \"sharks\"), who then decide whether or not to invest in that company.  The investors give a certain amount of money in exchange for a percentage stake in the company (\"equity\"). If you are not familiar with the show, you may want to watch part of an episode [here](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank) to get a sense of how it works. You can also search for a clip on YouTube. \n","\n","The data that you will examine in this lab contains data about all contestants from the first 6 seasons of the show, including:\n","- the name and industry of the proposed company\n","- whether or not it was funded (i.e., the \"Deal\" column)\n","- which sharks chose to invest in the venture (N.B. There are 7 regular sharks, not including \"Guest\". Each shark has a column in the data set, labeled by their last name.)\n","- if funded, the amount of money the sharks put in and the percentage equity they got in return\n","\n","To earn full credit on this lab, you should:\n","- use built-in `pandas` methods (like `.sum()` and `.max()`) instead of writing a for loop over a `DataFrame` or `Series`\n","- use the split-apply-combine pattern wherever possible\n","\n","Of course, if you can't think of a vectorized solution, a `for` loop is still better than no solution at all!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Us6oobKlovvp","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ngi3x0nmovvw","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Question 0.
