As an example, consider a data set where each observation is a TV show. Many of the variables in this data set are what we would expect, such as the runtime of each show and what network it was broadcast on. But there are also variables that are unorthodox, such as the season and the cast. A TV show can have multiple seasons and multiple cast members, as illustated in the figure below.\n","\n","![](hierarchical_data.png)\n","\n","Can we represent all of this information in a single `DataFrame`? If each row represents a single show, then it is straightforward to have columns containing the runtimes, the premiere dates, and so on. But it is not obvious how to incorporate the season information into this `DataFrame` in a way that still makes this information accessible for analysis. There are multiple challenges:\n","\n","- A show has multiple seasons. We will need multiple columns, one for each season.\n","- The number of seasons varies from show to show. For example, \"Girls\" was on for 6 seasons, while \"The Golden Girls\" was on for 7. We will need to have at least 7 columns in our `DataFrame` to be able to store all the information for \"The Golden Girls\", even though we only need 6 columns for \"Girls\" (and perhaps even fewer for other shows).\n","- Each season has multiple variables associated with it, such as the premiere date and the end date. We will need a separate column for each of these variables.\n","\n","The resulting `DataFrame` might look something like this.\n","\n","|name    | runtime |  premiered  | season1premiere | season1end | ... | season7premiere | season7end | \n","|--------|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|-----|-----------------|------------|\n","| Girls | 30       | 2012-04-15  | 2012-04-15      | 2012-06-17 | ... | `NaN`           | `NaN`      |\n","| The Golden Girls | 30 | 1985-09-14 | 1985-09-14 | 1986-05-10 | ... | 1991-09-21 | 1992-05-09      |\n","| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n","\n","Furthermore, each season contains a different number of episodes. If we also want to store information about each episode, it is impractical to do so in a `DataFrame`.\n","\n","The problem is that this data is naturally hierarchical.
